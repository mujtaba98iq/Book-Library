Book Library is a Desktop Application that I've been working on from scratch, using ASP.NET Core Windows Forms, ADO.Net and Microsft SQL Server from Programming Advices Course 19.

It is an application aimed at managing and organizing books in a library, whether it's a public or private library. This project can include a variety of features to facilitate the process of adding books, categorizing them, browsing, and managing them. It can also include user management, where users can search for books and borrow them.

Thank you.
